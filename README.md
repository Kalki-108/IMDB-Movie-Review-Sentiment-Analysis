The primary objective of the project was to develop a deep learning-based IMDb movie review sentiment analysis model and deploy it as a web application accessible on mobile browsers. The project leveraged the IMDb dataset from Kaggle, employing an LSTM architecture for text classification.

Key highlights include data preprocessing, model building, and creating a user-friendly web application. The model achieved an impressive 87% accuracy on unseen test data, demonstrating its effectiveness. The web application allows users to input movie reviews and receive real-time sentiment predictions.

Future enhancements could involve expanding the model's capabilities to support multiple languages or developing a more sophisticated user interface
